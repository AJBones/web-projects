    <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a biochemistry DPhil student at the University of Oxford, based in
      the plant sciences department. I am working on developing sustainable fuel and
      chemical production using bacteria in the genus <i>Clostridium</i>. I am
      in my final year of research and am currently looking for job opportunities in
      research and technology.
    </p>
    <h3>Research Background and Skills</h3>
    <p>
      I have a first class BSc in Biochemistry and a MSc (Res) in Parasitology.
      My research for my Master's involved testing a panel of cancer cell lines
      for their ability to act as host cells for intracellular parasites in
      the genus <i>Cryptosporidium</i>. My DPhil research involves metabolic
      engineering, combining wet lab and computational approaches to improve
      <i>n-</i>butanol production in bacteria.

      I have experience in molecular biology research, as well as plant and
      mammalian tissue culture, working with anaerobic organisms and performing
      biochemical analysis using gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry. I
      have experience writing scripts and programs in Python 3, performing
      statistical analysis of data in R and using Git for version control.
